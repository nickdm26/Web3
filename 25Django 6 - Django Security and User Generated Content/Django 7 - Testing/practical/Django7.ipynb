    "Tests are simple routines that check the operation of your code. Testing operates at different levels. Some tests might apply to a tiny detail (does a particular model method return values as expected?) while others examine the overall operation of the software (does a sequence of user inputs on the site produce the desired result?). That’s no different from the kind of testing you did earlier in Django 3 Tutorial, using the shell to examine the behavior of a method, or running the application and entering data to check how it behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s different in automated tests is that the testing work is done for you by the system. You programmatically create a set of tests once, and then as you make changes to your app, you can automatically check that your code still works as you originally intended using your automated testing scripts, which liberates you from having to perform time consuming manual testing."

    "You may feel that ‘checking that my web application seems to work’ will be a satisfactory test in a work environment. However, when working with sophisticated application ‘checking that my web application seems to work’ is not good enough. In a complex application you might have dozens of complex/obscure interactions between components and usually several developers working on the application. A change in any of those components could have unexpected/unintended/unknown consequences on the application’s behavior. Checking that it still ‘seems to work’ could mean running through your code’s functionality with twenty different variations of your test data just to make sure you haven’t broken something - not a good use of your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s especially true when automated tests could do this for you in seconds. If something’s gone wrong, tests will also assist in identifying the code that’s causing the unexpected behavior. Sometimes it may seem a chore to do the unglamorous and unexciting business of writing tests, particularly when you know your code is working properly. However, the task of writing tests is more fulfilling than spending hours testing your application manually or trying to identify the cause of a newly-introduced problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when working in complex applications maintained by teams, tests guarantee that colleagues don’t inadvertently break your code (and that you don’t break theirs without knowing). If you want to make a living as a programmer, you must be good at writing tests!"

    "Some programmers follow a discipline called “*test-driven development*”. This means that the programmer actually writes tests before he writes his code. More often, a newcomer to testing will create some code and later decide that it should have some tests. Perhaps it would have been better to write some tests earlier, but it’s never too late to get started. Sometimes you're working on code you know is reliable. In such a case, it’s fruitful to write your first test the next time you make a change, either when you add a new feature or fix a bug."
