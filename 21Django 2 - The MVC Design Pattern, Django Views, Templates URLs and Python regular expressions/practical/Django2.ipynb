    "In order for Django to match URLs to views, Django uses the Python **`re`** library  for “regular expressions”. To understand the advantages of regular expressions imagine a situation in which you have a website with the following address http://www.mysite.com/post/12345/ where the number 12345, indicates the number of your post. Writing separate views for each post numbers stored in your blog application would be really inefficient. With regular expressions we can create a pattern that will match the URL and extract the post number for us. For instance, the pattern ^post/(\\d+)/$ matches the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ^post/ is telling Django to take anything that has post/ at the beginning (hence the usage of ^) of the url path \n",
    "- (\\d+) means that there will be a number (\\d+ one or more digits) and that we want the number captured and extracted, that is why we surround the pattern in parentheses ()\n",
    "- / tells django that another / character should follow\n",
    "- $ indicates the end of the URL meaning that only strings ending with the / will match this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create our first URL That maps a location within our website to a view to handle the HTTP response. We want to make the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/, the default homepage of our blog to display a list of posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to keep the `mysite/urls.py` file clean, so we will import urls from our blog application to the main `mysite/urls.py` file. Delete everything  in the `mysite/urls.py` file and instead add the following which includes a line that will import `blog.urls` into the main url (''). Your `mysite/urls.py` file should now look like this:"
