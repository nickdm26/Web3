    "The Django REST framework (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. Some reasons you might want to use a REST framework are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.\n",
    "- Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1 and OAuth2.\n",
    "- Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.\n",
    "- Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.\n",
    "- Extensive documentation, and great community support.\n",
    "- Used and trusted by large companies such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Mozilla.\n",
